<h3>Gifted and Talented Band and Honor Band</h3>

<p>The <em>Howard County Middle School Gifted &amp; Talented (GT) Band and Honor Band</em> provide a county-wide musical experience for the most advanced and accomplished band musicians in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. Each middle school band director receives the audition requirements in September, which are the same as the Maryland Junior All State Band requirements (available at http://www.mmea-maryland.org/band/). The audition date will precede the Junior All State Band audition date. The audition will be used to determine acceptance in the Howard County Middle School GT Band and the Howard County Middle School Honors Band. Students must audition to be considered for either ensemble. Rehearsals, dress rehearsals, and the concert take place during the month of January. </p>

In order to be aligned with the purpose of the Gifted and Talented Program the orchestras have been named GT Sinfonia and GT Orchestra.</p>

<p>The Sinfonia performs music one to two grade levels above the curricular standard and the GT Orchestra performs music three or more levels above the curricular standard. Both the Sinfonia and Orchestra are audition-based ensembles that run for the entire school year.

<h3>Honors Chorus</h3>

<p>The purpose of the <em>Howard County Middle School Honors Chorus</em> is to provide an enrichment opportunity for talented sixth grade singers from each middle school in Howard County, where they can perform together in a large choral setting one weekend in early February. Participants are nominated in October by their school’s choral director and will be required to attend an evening rehearsal on Friday, and an all-day rehearsal Saturday on the same weekend as the scheduled Sunday concert. Optional preparatory rehearsals will be offered for students throughout November, December, and January as they learn and practice their music for this one weekend event.</p>

<h3>Gifted and Talented Chorus</h3>
