	<h1>Music</h1>
</div>

<p>Music education is a vital component of the total education a student receives. Through the study of music, all students develop knowledge and skills that prepare them to experience the power of music in human existence. Students identify, decode, and interpret symbols, becoming literate musicians and translate that understanding into an emotional experience. They discover music as a unique form of communication and as a means of self-expression not afforded by any other discipline.</p>

<p>The Howard County Public School System prepares students for the creation, practice, study, criticism, and teaching of music, in a context that emphasizes cultural diversity, community engagement, and technical innovation. As a performing art, music builds self-discipline and promotes self-esteem in ways that are not inherent in other curricular offerings. Because of the ordered nature of the elements of music, students learn to think with increased complexity; because of the creative potential in music, they learn to think in divergent ways.</p>
