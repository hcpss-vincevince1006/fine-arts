<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The fine arts (theatre, visual art, music and dance) are among humanity’s greatest achievements. The arts communicate a broad range of customs, beliefs, ideas and feelings; they are the primary means of transmitting culture throughout history, influencing an enormous range of human activity and discovery. As such the arts are an essential part of every child’s learning and cognitive development, sharpening analytical skills, encouraging abstract associations, innovative thinking, and creative problem solving. </p>

<p>Through the active study of the fine arts, it is our hope and belief that students, supported by a rigorous and innovative environment, develop a genuine desire for the highest level of achievement.</p>
