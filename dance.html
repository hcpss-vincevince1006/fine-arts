<p>Dance provides the opportunity for students in Grades 9-12 to develop aesthetic sensitivity and experience intellectual, physical, emotional and social growth through movement. Students observe, respond, create, and perform using the body as an instrument to communicate feelings, thoughts, and ideas. Through exploring dance concepts, students demonstrate critical thinking skills and core values as well as develop personal integrity. Dance education fosters positive student interaction and an appreciation for diverse points of view, while establishing strong human bonds which transcend racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic barriers. The sequentially developed program presents a broad cultural and historical perspective, providing unique opportunities for cross-curricular connections.</p>
